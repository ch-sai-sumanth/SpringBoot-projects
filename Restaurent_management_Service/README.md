* ## Frameworks and languages used

    **Spring Boot**

    Spring Boot is a popular framework for building web applications and microservices using the Java programming language. It provides a streamlined development experience and makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.

    Spring Boot is built using the Java programming language and is designed to work with a variety of other Java-based frameworks, including:

    * Spring Framework
    * Hibernate
    * Apache Struts
    * Apache Camel
    * Apache CXF
    * Apache Kafka

    **Java**

    Java is also used with a variety of other frameworks and tools, including:

    Android Studio: A popular integrated development environment (IDE) for building Android mobile applications using Java.

    Eclipse: An open-source IDE that is widely used for developing Java-based applications.

    IntelliJ IDEA: A popular IDE for developing Java applications that provides advanced features like code refactoring, code completion, and debugging.

    Maven: A popular build automation tool for Java projects that helps to manage project dependencies and automate the build process.



* ## Data flow

    * **1.controller**
    In Spring MVC, controller methods are the final destination point that a web request can reach. After being invoked, the controller method starts to process the web request by interacting with the service layer to complete the work that needs to be done.

    * **2.services**
    Service Components are the class file which contains @Service annotation. These class files are used to write business logic in a different layer, separated from @RestController class file.

    * **3. Repository**
    Repository is mainly used for managing the data in a Spring Boot Application. We all know that Spring is considered to be a very famous framework of Java. We mainly use this Spring Boot to create the Spring-based stand-alone and production-based applications with a very minimal amount of effort.
    @Repository annotation is used to indicate that the class provides the mechanism for storage, retrieval, search, update and delete operation on objects

    * **4.DataBase Design**
    MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) widely used for storing and managing data. When we refer to a "MySQL local database," it typically means a MySQL database installed and running on your local machine or computer.

    A local MySQL database allows you to create and manage databases on your own system, providing a convenient way to store and retrieve data for personal or small-scale applications. You can interact with the database using the MySQL command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI) tools like phpMyAdmin.

    With a local MySQL database, you can create tables to organize your data, define relationships between tables, and perform various operations such as inserting, updating, and querying data. It supports SQL (Structured Query Language), which is the standard language for interacting with relational databases.

    Using a local MySQL database offers benefits such as quick access to data, efficient data storage and retrieval, and the ability to develop and test applications without relying on a remote server. It is commonly used for web development, content management systems, data-driven applications, and more.

    Remember that a local MySQL database is specific to your machine, so it may not be accessible to other devices unless you set up networking and remote access configurations.

* ## Data Structure used in this project

    **Iterable**

    An Iterable is a Java interface that represents a collection of objects that can be iterated over, or looped through. It defines a method called iterator() that returns an Iterator object, which can be used to iterate over the collection's elements one by one.

    The Iterable interface is used in Java to represent data structures that can be iterated over, such as lists, sets, and maps. It is a fundamental building block of Java's Collections framework, which provides a rich set of classes and interfaces for working with collections of objects.

    Here are some of the key benefits and use cases of using Iterable data type:

    Iterating over collections: The Iterable interface provides a standardized way to iterate over collections of objects, making it easy to loop through the elements of a list, set, or map and perform operations on each element.

    Improved code readability: Using the Iterable interface in your code can make it more readable and easier to understand, since it provides a clear and consistent way to work with collections.

    Enhanced compatibility: By using the Iterable interface, you can write code that works with any collection that implements the interface, regardless of the underlying data structure. This makes your code more flexible and portable across different systems and environments.

    Streamlined code development: The Iterable interface provides a standard set of methods for working with collections, reducing the need for developers to write custom code for iterating over and working with collections.

    Overall, the Iterable data type is a powerful tool for working with collections of objects in Java. It provides a standardized way to iterate over and work with collections, improving code readability, compatibility, and streamlining code development.

* ## Project Summary

    The "Restaurant Management System" is a Spring Boot project that aims to provide a platform for managing restaurants efficiently. The system includes various types of users such as visitors, administrators, and normal users, each with different roles and permissions.

    One of the core entities in the system is the food list, which represents the menu items available in the restaurant. It allows users to view and interact with the list of foods, including details like prices, descriptions, and availability.

    Another essential entity is the restaurant, which stores information about the restaurant itself, such as its name, location, contact details, and opening hours. This entity helps in organizing and categorizing restaurants within the system.

    The project incorporates user authentication to ensure secure access to the system. Visitors can explore the system without authentication, while administrators and normal users must authenticate themselves using their credentials before accessing certain features. This authentication process helps maintain data integrity and restricts unauthorized access.

    Overall, the "Restaurant Management System" is a Spring Boot project that facilitates efficient restaurant management. It provides user roles, such as visitors, administrators, and normal users, along with entities like food lists and restaurants. User authentication ensures secure access to the system and its features.
